Key Logger (Educational and Ethical Use)

- Overview
The Key Logger project is a Pythonbased tool designed for educational purposes. It simulates how key loggers operate, raises awareness about their potential risks, and educates users on detecting and mitigating such attacks. The tool logs keystrokes to a file to demonstrate the functionality of a key logger in an ethical manner.

- Features
•	Simulates Key Logging: Captures keyboard input and logs keystrokes to a file.
•	Educational Use: Helps users understand the risks posed by malicious key loggers.
•	Simple to Use: Provides a clear and straightforward implementation using Python.
•	CrossPlatform: Built using the pynput library for compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- Objective
•	To demonstrate how key loggers work in an ethical and controlled environment.
•	To highlight the risks posed by malicious key loggers.
•	To provide countermeasures for detecting and mitigating key logger attacks.

- Technologies Used
•	Python: Core programming language for implementation.
•	pynput Library: Used for capturing and processing keyboard input.

- How It Works
1.	Key Capture:
o	The key logger listens for keyboard events.
o	Captures each key press (including special keys like space and enter).
o	Logs the keystrokes with timestamps to a file (key_log.txt).
2.	Stopping the Key Logger:
o	The tool runs continuously until the ESC key is pressed.
3.	Educational Purpose:
o	Designed to demonstrate how malicious key loggers operate while emphasizing ethical use and countermeasures.

- Security Countermeasures
How to Protect Against Key Loggers:
1.	Antivirus Software: 
o	Use uptodate antivirus software to detect and block malicious key loggers.
2.	Process Monitoring: 
o	Monitor running processes and applications using tools like Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (macOS).
3.	TwoFactor Authentication (2FA): 
o	Enable 2FA for accounts to add a layer of security even if credentials are compromised.
4.	Virtual Keyboards: 
o	Use onscreen keyboards for sensitive data like passwords or banking information.
5.	Awareness: 
o	Avoid downloading software from untrusted sources.
o	Be cautious of phishing attempts and suspicious links.

- Limitations
•	Educational Purpose Only: 
o	This tool is designed to simulate basic key logging functionality for ethical use only.
•	Not Stealthy: 
o	This implementation is not designed to bypass detection by antivirus software.
•	Basic Functionality: 
o	Only captures keyboard input and logs it to a file. Advanced malicious key logging techniques (e.g., capturing clipboard data) are not included.
